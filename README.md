### Jire
Just a sweet little RuneScape emulator.

We'll try to have you covered by...
* Giving you our one and only plugin system; bringing light to dynamic unattached event dispatches in the community
* Embracing Java's type system in the fullest, restricting unwanted behaviors at _compile time_
* Providing always readily extensive interfacing so that implementation detail doesn't hold back future potentials
* Wisely structuring the codebase to allow instant notional understandment and promote modularity
* No implicity- we'll explicitly state requirements (whether such statements are forced by code itself or documented) to ensure a surprise-free library for ourselves and other developers (oh, did we mention that you should become involved?)
* Listen for extensive review and feedback to coordinate future development plans of infrastructure- large or small
* Having a blast while we're at it
